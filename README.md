# CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

## Project Overview

This project involves building an interactive web application using JavaScript to display menu items for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal is to create a simple and visually engaging menu display system that allows users to add items to their order with ease. The main objective is create and use functions to dynamically populate the menu items on the page, implement a callback function to handle adding items to the order, use closures to maintain the state of the order, utilize function expressions and anonymous functions and call built-in functions and create custom functions to manage the menu and order system.

## Getting Started 

+ Setting Up the Project Files: Create three files - index.html, index.css, and index.js, and link the CSS and JS files to the HTML document.

+ HTML Structure: Build the HTML structure for the application, including placeholders for the menu items and the order summary using appropriate <div> elements with IDs or classes for styling and scripting.

+ Styling: Use CSS to style the menu and order summary, ensuring a visually appealing, responsive, and easy-to-navigate user interface.

+ JavaScript Implementation: Utilize the provided starter code in index.js as a foundation for the application. This involves working with the menu object, creating and displaying menu items grouped by category, implementing the addToOrder callback function, and calling the initMenuSystem function to attach event listeners to menu items.

+ Testing: Thoroughly test the application to ensure correct filtering of items by category, the ability to add items to the order, and the expected update of the order total.

## Learning Outcome

+ The learning outcome in this project is for us to be able to apply the new knowledge , particularly in the context of creating an interactive web application using JavaScript. 

+ This involves the ability to dynamically populate the menu items on the page, implement a callback function to handle adding items to the order, use closures to maintain the state of the order, and utilize function expressions and anonymous functions. 

+ We are able to create and display menu items grouped by category, attach event listeners to menu items, and thoroughly test the application to ensure correct functionality. 

+ The emphasis is on the ability to apply knowledge to create an engaging and functional menu display system for CodeCuisine, demonstrating proficiency in JavaScript and web application development.
